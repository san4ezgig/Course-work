All transition probabilities are in the GeneratorCreator class, and the transition probability matrices in arbitrary time in the ArbitararyTimeGenerator class. All tests in the class test, except for the test for tau, it is in the StationaryDistributionCreator class. If you run a program with system size 1 and numberOfPerfomanceFunction == 11, the program will calculate and draw everything for the system M|G|1 and display 6 jpg files with names 21..26. If the system size == 2, it draws for MAP|G|1 and displays in 6 jpg files with numbers 11 - 16.
